It's a tad hard to describe oneself. I do consider myself an avid outdoorsman who can be found happily snowboarding, hiking or dragon boating depending on the season. After all, one cannot be called a true Vermonter and not take advantage of the beautiful outdoors the Green Mountain state has on offer. Currently, I am an AWS Certified Solution Architect loving Rust and is a bit of a tinkerer with an interest in cloud computing, architecture & programming languages.
