Browsing became a pain. Racked my brains for days and tried different antiviruses, deleting weird looking entries from the registry, HijackThis etc…and finally the WMD itself: VundoFix. Nothing worked.Nada!&#160; Honestly, I admire the guy(s) who wrote this thing.&#160; Don’t ask how i got infected; okay went down a “dark alley” online to get some prized warez. </p>  <p>So here i am, with this laptop running Windows Live OneCare and i get&#160; the notification above . A security software suite whose firewall component is suspicious of its OWN aiding component. Jeez! No wonder the folks who screwed up my pc are encouraged. </p>
