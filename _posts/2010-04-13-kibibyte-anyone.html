<p align="justify">So here i am after a pretty long hiatus. I somehow forgot i had a blog to maintain - no it was not due to amnesia or any form of dementia. A sudden onset of acute procrastination was the diagnosis; a disruptive trait&#160; for which i am still strictly following the prescribed treatments. For obvious reasons, i decline to state what they are&#160; as they are highly addictive for the curious minded.&#160; Sheesh! I should have been a doc. </p>  <p align="justify">Hmmm, a while back,&#160; helping do bug triaging for the <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a> app <a href="http://dolphin.kde.org/">Dolphin</a>, i came across a&#160; feature request for an option to change the unit of measurement for the various folder &amp; file sizes per the user’s preferences. Whereas most are familiar with the good old kilo, mega, giga SI decimal prefixes; binary prefixes for digital data: kibi, mebi, gibi etc,&#160; are totally off-radar.&#160; Wikipedia does an excellent job explaining what they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#IEC_prefixes">here</a>.&#160; Although, this is really simple to implement –<em>monkeying</em> around with Dolphin’s source to produce a solution is fairly straightforward- KDE’s&#160; maintainers were just not going to make changes to the trunk to satisfy those of us weaned on the SI Units. A 6 year long <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57240">thread</a> on this subject follows the arguments for/against including it. </p>  <p align="justify">Despite their best intentions, until&#160; my granny can use a Linux distro without me on hand to explain what’s going on or the ‘apocalyptic’ event of Microsoft doing an Enron/Lehman…i pretty much have my shirt on folks not knowing what a kibibyte is. Say what? </p>
