<p>So here I was snooping around Mozilla’s Bugzilla  hoping to ferret out an interesting bug to quash when I stumbled on this peculiar bug, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95849" target="_blank">95849</a>. Definitely, this is the joke that keeps on giving and for a good solid ten years it has certainly delivered the laughs. It’s things such as this that makes the hours spent poring over code all the more worthwhile and enjoyable. Kudos to all the commenters and contributors! </p>
