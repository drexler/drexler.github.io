<p>Instead of initiating a Firefox build from the command line , I have a script that I use to get Visual Studio to build and pipe the output to the Output window.&nbsp; Chalk it down to being too lazy to switch windows and enter the build command at the console<em>. </em>Often warning errors flash by and clicking them just stops the output auto-scroll. It can be re-enabled with [Ctrl] + [End]. I just wish it could have been built into the context menu of the window.&nbsp; Oh, wellâ€¦.probably will get it in the upgrade to VS 2012.</p>
