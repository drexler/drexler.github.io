Finally got round to rebuilding my musty mouldy repo a couple of days back and began to check in some patches albeit easy ones just to get back in the groove. Next stop for me will be upgrading to VS2013. As usual, i need to have the best tool out there to<i> </i>play around with although emacs &amp; Eclipse will continue to be my main preference for development. What can i say? A dork gotta have his <i>toy. </i>
