For the past few days, i've spent time dipping my feet in the Android SDK and generally building baby apps to get a feel and understanding of them. This is in preparation for a larger app i'm building as part of my side projects at work so its fun all around. In the past, i've dabbled with Symbian S60 and pre- BB OS 7 but when it comes to app development the ease with which one can just get a working app installed and tested is astounding. Definitely loving it so far!&nbsp;
