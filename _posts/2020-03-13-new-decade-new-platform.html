So it's been two years since my last update and I've generally been too preoccupied(lazy?) to update this blog. I started on Blogger back in 2009 to showcase
a side project employing Java and good ol' Adobe Air when using Flash/Flex was all the rage. Sidenote: does anyone use GWT these days? Over time, as I've invested my efforts 
mostly on Github projects - both personal and open source-related  - it became apparent that consolidating both my blog and other projects on a common platform
was the way forward. I wanted a minimalist-styled blog without too much effort; building one in React was under consideration since it's a library i work with. 
My inner geek still wanted the barebones and thus Jekyll & Github Pages won out. The migration effort was fairly straightforward.
